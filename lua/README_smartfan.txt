Here's what has happened so far: 
3/12/15: Cesar and Michael hacked fan, put in relays, wired it all back together. 
Coming from the breadboard:
brown - Vcc (5V)
Red - ground
Orange - low speed
Green - medium speed
yellow - high speed

The fan is tested and works. NOTE: the relays draw current in the range where we probably can't drive it with the firestorm directly.
